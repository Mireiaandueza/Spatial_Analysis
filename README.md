# Spatial Analysis

This is the GitHub repository associated with my master's thesis "Spatial characterization of the dynamic changes driven by the PDAC risk variant  Ctrb1 Î” exon6  in mouse pancreas" for the master in Bioinformatics and Compuational Biology at the Autonomus University of Madrid.

This work was carried out at the Epithelial Carcinogenesis group at the CNIO.
